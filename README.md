Lattice Boltzmann methods is a common fluid flow modeling concept. It is considered a pore scale technique as it is able to model poe scale phenomenon. Several publications exist on this method for interested readers. These set of scripts ultimately aim to be able to couple the LBM method to a geochemical reaction module.

## How To Use
LBM OOP is developed using Object Oriented Programming concepts. Installation is described below. 

The code will work by reading in inputs from a strictly formatted text file. The format of the flow and transport input files is saved under lbm-file format.txt. All modeling parameters should be inputed using the format.



#### Installation
Use of the code requires the installation of external python libraries Numpy and Pandas. 


#### Example

```html
    Examples will be made soon
